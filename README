== Checkout ==

  kinit
  git clone p-krb5conf@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/projects/krb5conf-fermilab-conf_kerberos

== Make Config changes ==

The config file is broken out into sections under:

  SOURCES/krb5.conf.d/

You can test your changes have gone into effect and will be packaged with:

  make krb5conf | less

== Make RPM ==
NOTE: From the checkout directory

  make sources
  rpmbuild -ba --define "%_topdir `pwd`" SPECS/fermilab-conf_kerberos.spec
  find RPMS -type f 
  find SRPMS -type f 

== Make Full Config ==

NOTE: From the checkout directory

  make krb5conf > outfile

== Make Koji Happy ==

So here is my fairly hacky workaround....

  git clone p-krb5conf@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/projects/krb5conf-fermilab-conf_kerberos
  git remote add github git@github.com:fermilab-context-rpms/fermilab-conf_kerberos.git
  git push --force --set-upstream github main

You'll need the relevant commit rights to all these repos.  Then you can just:

  koji build MYTAGNAME 'git+https://github.com/fermilab-context-rpms/fermilab-conf_kerberos.git?#HEAD'

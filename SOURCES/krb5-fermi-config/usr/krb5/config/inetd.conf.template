# inetd.conf.template for kerberos services.
# This file is used by the installation script
# to modify the system's inetd.conf file.
# The installation script will substitute the appropriate value
# of /usr/krb5 as defined in the kerberos
# table file.
# The installation script will also determine if you have actually
# wrapped these services in tcpwrappers via /some/path/to/tcpd,
# and will maintain that state (i.e., if it was wrapped before,
# it will be wrapped after the kerberos installation).
#
#
# the following lines tell the installation script
# which services are basically the same thing.
# Syntax:
# # EQUAL: <original_service_name> <kerberized_service_name>
#
# EQUAL: shell kshell
# EQUAL: login klogin
# EQUAL: exec eklogin

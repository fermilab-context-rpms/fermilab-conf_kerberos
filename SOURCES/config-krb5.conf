# This script will make sure that the appropriate
# krb configuration file exists in the correct location.
#
# Details:
#	a) determine if AFS is running on the current node
#	b) save a copy of existing configuration file with a datestamp
#	c) merge new information from krb5.conf.template -- replace
#	   everything above the warning line with the corresponding
#	   new file contents, and rewrite the user's version of anything
#	   below that line.  Set aklog to true if AFS is running.
#	d) log the installation to nodename in $UPS_UPS_DIR/nodename.log
#	   (so that it's easy to see which nodes still need to be
#	   configured)
#
#
# History:
# 23Jun1999	lauri	Initial.
# 26Aug1999	crawdad	v0_2 (adds AFS support)
# 22Oct1999	lauri	Add AFS checks so that we can have ONE
#			version of krb5conf which is smart enough
#			to modify the krb5.conf file (instead of
#			messing with -q afs).
# 30Mar2000	lauri	As per FUE guidelines, change the portions
#			of this that need to be done as root to a
#			separate 'installAsRoot' action; modify usage
#			documentation accordingly.  We no longer
#			actively encourage modification of the
#			krb5.conf file, so remove the whole check
#			of "DO NOT EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE" business.
# 02Jun2000	lauri	Don't overwrite the file if there are no
#			significant differences.
# 28Dec2000	crawdad For v1_0, delete stale bits about qualifiers on
#			this product.  Change the "significant changes"
#			test to ignore all blank and comment lines.
# 28Mar2001	crawdad	Do not clobber existing stuff "below the line".
# 27Aug2001	dawson	Pulled all the ups stuff out of the script
# 18Aug2006	nagy	Retain .fnal.gov lines in [domain_realm]
# 19Aug2010	nagy	Drop all old edits (including "below the line")
#			in favor of local KDC list if found in local file
#			/etc/krb5.kdclist but keep the AFS edits; copied
#			edits from UPS installAsRoot file
# 07Jun2011	nagy	Correct product version
# 13Sep2011	nagy	Corrected product version
